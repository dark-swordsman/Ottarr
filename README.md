The goal of Ottarr is to provide an easy way to manage Anime, TV Shows, and Movies.

- Want to bulk add multiples series, have them download automatically, and then link automatically (even if they're from the 90s)?
- Want to add an RSS feed for your favorite website and have it automatically download your anime?
- Want to not have to worry about your favorite downloading program crapping itself and be able to bulk add everything back to it without manually adding the folders?

Well then this is the software for you!
